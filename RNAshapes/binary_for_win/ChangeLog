Version 2.1.5   Apr. 15. 2008
	* changed definition of shape types
	* new option -A to omit output of samples in sampling mode
	* new option -y to set the minimal length of subshapes
Version 2.1.2   Apr. 13. 2006
        * new option -U for direct start of graphical user interface
Version 2.1.1   Feb. 2. 2006
	* interactive mode now with complete interface to all program
	  options 
	* optional colored output 
	* consensus shapes analysis with output support for RNAforester
	  (-o f)
	* some small changes in Java GUI

Version 2.1     Dec. 29. 2005
	* included graphical user interface (implemented in Java) by Marco

Version 2.0.1   Oct. 26. 2005
	* Consensus shapes mode: in some cases (shapes with the same
	energy), the printed shape rank differed from the shape rank
	printed by the original RNAcast. Now fixed.
        * segmentation fault with some inputs and option -C fixed
	* shape-rank can now also be configured with format string
