Graphical user interfaces
---------------------------
We offer two graphical user interfaces for RNAshapes:

- Java implementation by Marco Ruether: It can be used on all
  computers with Java support (Java 1.4.2 or newer required --
  download from http://java.sun.com/j2se/). To start the user
  interface, type

    java -jar RNAshapesGUI.jar

  By default, the user interface expects the RNAshapes binary in the
  same directory as the RNAshapesGUI.jar file. You can change this by
  selecting Edit->Preferences from the menu bar.

- Graphical user interface for Microsoft Windows: The RNAshapes user
  interface for Windows requires no Java installation and provides
  some additional features like interactive secondary structure
  visualization. It is included in the RNAshapes binary package for
  Windows (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnashapes/).
